While all these people seem to be outraged about Trump in one way or another
he seems to be on track implementing the things he promised.

But some are eagerly waiting for tax cuts he's had in [his tax reform][tax-pdf]
plans:

> 1. If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn
less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly
75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. They get a new
**one page form to send the IRS saying, “I win,”** those who would otherwise owe
income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each.

Emphasis mine.

If this'll actually happen, it'd be a good thing. It'll be in the face of the
thugs at the IRS who're [ruining lives][ruined-lives] of the little man while
[criminal big money is running around freely][big-money].
