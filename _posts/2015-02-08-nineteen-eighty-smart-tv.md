A short and good read is the [privacy policy][1] of Samsung's SmartTV line.

> If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service that converts speech to text or to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you. In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features. **Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.**

You see, Samsung admittedly gave us [telescreens][2] and I can already hear sheep
scream and shout "This is not 1984. The book's far worse.", rushing to buy the newest and biggest model.
