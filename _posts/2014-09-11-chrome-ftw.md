Chrome supported [device emulation][1] for a while now but it was always rather simple
in terms of functionallity. [Version 38 has this][2]:

There's even shortcuts to toggle the emulator. I love it. Mobile-first was always
some sort of pita for me. I think this'll ease things up.

And Google has done it. I'll never be able to migrate away from Chrome.
