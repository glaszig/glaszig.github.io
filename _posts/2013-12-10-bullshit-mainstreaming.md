Finally, [gender mainstreaming](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm) and related [commits](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/commit/804d40ee14dc0f82c482dcc8d1c41c14333fcb48), [pull requests and discussions](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015)
 have found their way into the software community. It may
very well have been there since don't-know-don't-care but at least an uproar is [audible](http://gigaom.com/2013/12/02/slap-fight-in-node-js-land/).

It looks like a simple [language barrier has hit here](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/collaboration-not-derision-in-the-node-community/) but people appear to be just too indoctrinated by
[UN-dictacted propaganda](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/e65237.pdf)
(look, isn't that gradient beautyful) to keep a cool head.  
Even better, not complying to Orwell'ish de- and obstruction of language, not
being politically correct (however defined by somebody else), [will cause people losing their jobs](http://www.joyent.com/blog/the-power-of-a-pronoun).

Bravo. Cowardly we bow down to the dictate of ever growing fears of being called a sexist, overshadowed by the gods thoughtcrime. We really have come a long way. As a flock of sheep.
