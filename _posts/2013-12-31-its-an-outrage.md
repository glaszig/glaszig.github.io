Somebody just [spoke what he thinks is the truth](https://www.theinformation.com/YC-s-Paul-Graham-The-Complete-Interview)
and the Internet
[is](http://paulgraham.com/wids.html)
[about](http://valleywag.gawker.com/paul-graham-says-women-havent-been-hacking-for-the-pa-1490581236)
to [explode](http://www.thewire.com/technology/2013/12/paul-graham-revives-sexism-tech-talk/356541/).

Following my [previous post](/sheeplog/2013/12/bullshit-mainstreaming.html)
a few days ago it should now be evident even to sheep on the far side of the moon
that this whole dont-you-dare-saying-men-and-women-are-different balony is nuts.
It's only purpose is to devide society, to be conquered. This biased agitation
is not about enabling the female part anymore. It keeps sheep running in cirlces
unable to care about important things. It collaterally creates dissidents of an
agenda that nobody seems recognize as being shoved down their throat. Objection is futile.

If you still feel like needing a resolution for the coming year, I'd suggest to start
not giving sheep a plattform anymore. Happy new year, fellow sexists.
